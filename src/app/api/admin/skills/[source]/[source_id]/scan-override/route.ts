/**
 * Admin scan-override route.
 *
 * Lets a platform admin explicitly green-light a skill that the
 * security scanner has marked ``"flagged"``. The override stamps a
 * ``scan_override`` audit sub-doc on the skill (set_by/set_at/
 * reason/prior_scan_status) and writes a row to
 * ``skill_scan_override_history``. ``scan_status`` is intentionally
 * NOT touched — the scanner's verdict is preserved as-is.
 *
 * Why the override is a separate field instead of ``scan_status =
 * "admin_overridden"``: the previous design encoded the override
 * into the status string itself, which collided with every scanner
 * write path. Any rescan (per-skill, scan-all, hub auto-scan after
 * recrawl) would blindly write ``scan_status = "flagged"`` and
 * silently nuke the override. Splitting the signals lets scan
 * routes write status freely while the override stays stable until
 * an admin explicitly clears it.
 *
 * Two methods, mirror-image:
 *
 *   POST   ``/api/admin/skills/:source/:source_id/scan-override``
 *          — set an override. Requires ``reason`` in the body.
 *   DELETE ``/api/admin/skills/:source/:source_id/scan-override``
 *          — clear an override. Optional ``reason`` for the audit row.
 *
 * Both gates:
 *   - ``admin_ui#admin`` RBAC permission (write action; 403 for non-admin)
 *   - ``ADMIN_SCAN_OVERRIDE_ENABLED !== "false"`` (env-flag escape
 *     hatch; 503 with a message pointing operators to the env var)
 *   - Mongo configured (503 if not — overrides only make sense for
 *     persisted skills)
 *
 * Why the route is admin-only via env, not group membership alone:
 * regulated environments need a way to remove the escape hatch
 * entirely. ``ADMIN_SCAN_OVERRIDE_ENABLED=false`` blocks writes here
 * AND makes the runtime gate ignore any existing ``scan_override``
 * sub-doc (Python ``scan_gate.is_skill_blocked`` and Node
 * ``applyRunnableGate``). Both tiers read the same env var.
 *
 * Why ``:source`` is in the URL even though only ``agent_skills`` is
 * supported today: future per-skill overrides for hub-sourced skills
 * (and possibly built-in template overrides) will live at the same
 * path with a different ``:source`` segment. Encoding it now means
 * the UI doesn't have to migrate URLs later. The handler explicitly
 * 400s for unsupported sources so the contract is unambiguous.
