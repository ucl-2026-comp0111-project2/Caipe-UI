/**
 * GET /api/review-configs — list the supported AI Review targets.
 *
 * Returns the fixed registry from `lib/server/ai-review/defaults.ts` (one
 * entry per known target — agent system prompts, SKILL.md). The admin UI
 * uses this list to render its tab navigation; per-target configs live at
 * `/api/review-configs/{id}` and self-seed defaults on first read.
 *
 * There is no POST/DELETE: adding a new target is a code change, not an
 * admin action. Editing is done per-target via PUT.
