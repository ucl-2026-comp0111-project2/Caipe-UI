/**
 * @deprecated — prefer POST /api/skills/import (source-agnostic).
 *
 * Thin proxy that injects `source: "github"` and forwards to the unified
 * importer (FR-016). Kept for back-compat with any out-of-tree callers
 * that still POST to this URL or use the legacy single-`path: string`
 * body shape.
 *
 * Response stays byte-compatible with the historical `{ files, count }`
 * shape (no `conflicts` field) so existing callers don't break.
 *
 * Body: { repo: "owner/repo", path: "skills/my-skill", credentials_ref?: string }
 *   OR  { repo: "owner/repo", paths: ["skills/a", "skills/b"], credentials_ref?: string }
