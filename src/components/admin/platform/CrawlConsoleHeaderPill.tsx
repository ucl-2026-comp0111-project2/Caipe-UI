/**
 * Compact status pill for the admin header that surfaces the
 * current state of the global Crawl Console.
 *
 * Three reasons this is its own component:
 *
 *   1. The pill needs to render IN ADDITION to the dialog -- it's
 *      the always-visible reminder that crawls are running.
 *      Putting both in one component would couple the dialog's
 *      open/close state to the header's render, which forces
 *      the entire dialog tree to re-render on every header tick.
 *
 *   2. The header already lives at the top of the page; the
 *      dialog is a portal. Keeping them separate means the
 *      dialog's portal target doesn't need to live underneath
 *      the header DOM subtree.
 *
 *   3. The pill is conditionally rendered: hidden when no runs
 *      have happened yet, ghost when only finished runs exist,
 *      pulse when at least one run is in flight. Bundling the
 *      logic with the dialog would hurt readability.
