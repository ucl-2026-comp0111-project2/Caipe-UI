/**
 * Plain-English explainer for the migration warnings emitted by the
 * Keycloak RBAC reconciliation pipeline (see
 * `ui/src/lib/rbac/keycloak-rbac-reconciliation.ts` and
 * `ui/src/lib/rbac/keycloak-bootstrap-admins.ts`).
 *
 * Warnings end up in two places on the Admin → Security & Policy →
 * Keycloak panel:
 *
 *   1. The dedicated "Bootstrap admin reconciliation failed" amber
 *      bar at the top of the card, which renders one row per failed
 *      email (`<email>: <error>`).
 *   2. The general "Warnings" bar at the bottom of the card, which
 *      renders one row per non-bootstrap migration warning. Phase 3
 *      (spec 2026-05-24-derive-team-from-channel) removed all of the
 *      per-team / per-scope warnings, so today only the bootstrap-admin
 *      family is registered here. The pattern table is kept so new
 *      warning families can be added without rewriting the explainer.
 *
 * Both groups of strings are accurate but unfriendly to admins who
 * have not been living inside the RBAC system: they reference
 * uppercase env vars and ops-only concepts. This decoder turns each
 * known warning into a structured `{ title, body, fix? }` tooltip
 * explanation in the same "keep both technical and plain-English"
 * style we use for invariant IDs (see `invariant-explanations.ts` for
 * the wording-style policy).
 *
 * Design notes:
 *
 *   - The decoder is **pattern-based**, not exact-match: the raw
 *     warnings include captured values (email addresses, slugs,
 *     error text), so each family is matched with a regex that
 *     yields the captured params for the explanation.
 *   - Adding a new explainer means:
 *       1. add the warning string in `keycloak-rbac-reconciliation.ts`
 *          (or `keycloak-bootstrap-admins.ts`), and
 *       2. add a matching `WarningPattern` entry below.
 *     The tests in `warning-explanations.test.ts` lock in every
 *     family.
 *   - Unknown warnings still get a non-throwing generic explanation
 *     so the UI never blows up.
 *
 * The reason this lives next to the panel (rather than inside the
 * BFF migration code) is the same as for `invariant-explanations.ts`:
 * wording is presentation, not policy.
