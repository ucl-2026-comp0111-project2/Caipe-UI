/**
 * <TeamOwnershipFields> — the canonical group-based access-control control
 * bundle (spec 2026-06-03-unified-shareable-resource-rbac, US1, contract
 * ui-component.md).
 * assisted-by Codex Codex-sonnet-4-6
 *
 * Renders, for any shareable resource (agent, datasource, MCP tool, future
 * types):
 *   - an owner-team picker (single-select; disabled on edit unless transfers
 *     are allowed, in which case changing it directly marks a transfer),
 *   - a share-with-teams multi-select,
 *   - a read-only creator (provenance) line,
 *   - a not-a-member transfer confirmation when transferring to a team the
 *     caller does not belong to.
 *
 * The component is **controlled** and does not persist — the host editor saves
 * with its own button (consistent with the agent editor's button-save).
 *
 * Layout flexibility: the agent editor interleaves a visibility toggle between
 * the owner picker and the share section, and only shows sharing when
 * visibility is "team". Those are supported via `betweenOwnerAndShare` and
 * `showShare` so the agent editor can adopt this component without reordering
 * its UI (SC-006). RAG/MCP editors simply omit them.
