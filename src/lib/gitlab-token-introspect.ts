/**
 * GitLab token introspection helper used by the crawl console to
 * synthesize a precise scope-mismatch hint when a tree fetch
 * fails with an auth-shaped status (401 / 403 / 404).
 *
 * # Why this exists
 *
 * GitLab returns the same diagnostic cluster (401 / 403 / 404)
 * for several genuinely different problems:
 *
 *   - missing token
 *   - token from the wrong instance (gitlab.com vs self-hosted)
 *   - token missing the right scope
 *   - project doesn't exist
 *   - project exists but the user lacks access
 *
 * The most surprising of these in practice is the scope mismatch:
 * `read_repository` is enough for `git clone` but the REST API
 * tree endpoint requires `read_api` (or `api`). The user reported
 * exactly this failure mode -- their PAT had `read_repository`
 * checked but `read_api` was empty, and the tree endpoint
 * returned 404 (intentional cloaking on insufficient scope), so
 * the existing error message ("project not found") sent them
 * down the wrong debugging path.
 *
 * After an auth-shaped failure we probe ``GET
 * /personal_access_tokens/self`` -- which only requires the
 * token to be valid, not to have any specific scope -- and
 * inspect the returned ``scopes`` array. From that we can emit
 * one of three precise diagnoses:
 *
 *   1. Token responds with 200 and lacks the required REST scopes
 *      -> "scope_mismatch" hint listing the missing scopes.
 *   2. Token responds with 200 and has all required scopes -> the
 *      original auth failure was about ACCESS, not the token --
 *      surface "your token is valid but the user lacks access"
 *      hint.
 *   3. Token responds with 401 -> the token itself is invalid;
 *      surface "token expired or wrong instance" hint.
 *
 * # Why it's a separate module from formatGitLabFetchError
 *
 * formatGitLabFetchError is synchronous and based on STATIC state
 * (status code, env var presence). The introspection probe is
 * asynchronous, makes a real HTTP call, and uses DYNAMIC state
 * (scope list returned by the API). Mixing them would make
 * formatGitLabFetchError block on a network call and complicate
 * its tests; keeping them separate also lets us call the
 * introspection from places that aren't crawl helpers (e.g. a
 * future "test connection" admin button).
