/**
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * Comprehensive MCP OpenFGA tuple contract tests.
 *
 * Guards the alignment between:
 * - Team Resources UI selections (`<server_id>_*` in Mongo)
 * - BFF authorization (`mcp_server:<id>#can_read` / `#can_manage`)
 * - AgentGateway extAuthz (`tool:<id>/*#can_call`)
 * - MCP server lifecycle (create owner, delete cleanup targets)
 *
 * Pure tuple builders only — no Mongo/CAS imports.
