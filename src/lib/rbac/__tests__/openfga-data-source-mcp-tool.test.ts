/**
 * Tests for the `data_source` and `mcp_tool` OpenFGA tuple builders.
 *
 * The builders share the same shared-teams semantics as
 * `buildKnowledgeBaseRelationshipTupleDiff` so users get consistent
 * "Share with Teams" behavior across all three KB-adjacent resource
 * types. `mcp_tool` additionally emits a `user` relation per member
 * team because its model exposes `can_call` (mirroring `mcp_server`
 * invokers), so the proxy can render a Slack/agent-callable surface
 * for the team without needing a second tuple write.
