/**
 * Tests for `buildKnowledgeBaseRelationshipTupleDiff` shared-team handling.
 *
 * Mirrors the agent editor's shared-team semantics: adding a team writes
 * the reader+ingestor+manager set, removing a team emits matching deletes,
 * the owner team is always treated as "wanted" so duplicating it in the
 * shared list is a no-op, and invalid slugs are silently dropped.
