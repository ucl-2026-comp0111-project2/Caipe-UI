/**
 * Tests for the generalized shareable-resource reconciler core
 * (`buildShareableResourceTupleDiff` / `buildTeamGrantTuples`) introduced by
 * spec 2026-06-03-unified-shareable-resource-rbac, User Story 1.
 *
 * The core is the single home for the owner-team + share-with-teams effective
 * set diff (writes for owner ∪ shared, deletes for previousEffective \
 * nextEffective) plus the audit-only `creator` tuple and the data_source
 * `parent_kb` inheritance edge. The agent / knowledge_base / data_source /
 * mcp_tool builders all compose it — see SC-006 (their existing suites must
 * pass unchanged after the refactor).
