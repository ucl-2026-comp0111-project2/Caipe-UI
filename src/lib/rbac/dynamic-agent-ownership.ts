/**
 * Dynamic-agent ownership & visibility normalization.
 *
 * As of 2026-05-22 every dynamic agent is **team-owned**. The legacy
 * `visibility: 'private'` value was retired. This module is the single
 * source of truth for:
 *
 *   - Coercing inbound payloads (`'private' → 'team'`).
 *   - Validating that every agent has an `owner_team_slug` /
 *     `owner_team_id`.
 *   - Returning a structured warning the BFF can surface in response
 *     headers so old clients (and the editor UI) can spot the migration.
 *
 * History: see `docs/docs/changes/2026-05-22-remove-private-agents.md`.
 * The admin reconcile migration in
 * `ui/src/lib/rbac/migrations/dynamic-agents-private-removal.ts` walks
 * every Mongo doc and converts in place, so this coercion is only
 * exercised for the brief window where old docs/clients still flow
 * through the API.
