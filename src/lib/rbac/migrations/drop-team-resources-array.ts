/**
 * Drop the legacy `team.resources` array — OpenFGA is now the single source of
 * truth for team↔resource grants.
 *
 * BACKGROUND. Until the OpenFGA-read refactor, the admin Teams/Users views read
 * agents/tools/skills/etc. from a hand-curated `team.resources` array on the
 * `teams` doc. That array drifted from the OpenFGA tuples the create/share write
 * paths actually wrote (the documented Zanzibar dual-store anti-pattern): an
 * agent shared with a team appeared nowhere until an admin re-selected it by
 * hand. The reads now come from OpenFGA `list-objects`, so the array is dead
 * weight that can only re-introduce drift.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES. For every team doc still carrying a `resources` field:
 *   1. Backfill any grant present in `resources.*` but (possibly) missing in
 *      OpenFGA as the canonical tuple — strictly additive, idempotent (the
 *      writer no-ops identical writes). This is belt-and-suspenders on top of
 *      `universal_rebac_relationship_backfill_v1` (declared as a dependency),
 *      so no grant is lost if that backfill predates a later array edit.
 *   2. `$unset: { resources }` the field.
 *
 * Mirrors the grant→tuple mapping in `deriveUniversalRebacPlan` so reads and
 * this final backfill can never disagree:
 *   - agents        → team#member user   agent:<id>
 *   - agent_admins  → team#admin  manager agent:<id>
 *   - tools         → team#member caller  tool:<id>
 *   - knowledge_bases → team#member reader knowledge_base:<id>
 *   - skills        → team#member user   skill:<id>
 *   - tasks         → team#member user   task:<id>   (workflows)
 *   - tool_wildcard → team#member caller  tool:*  (intent sentinel — lets the
 *                     MCP-server reconciler keep auto-granting future servers
 *                     once the boolean flag is gone)
 *
 * Idempotent: a re-run finds no `resources` fields and is a no-op.
