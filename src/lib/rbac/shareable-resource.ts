/**
 * Route-orchestration helper for shareable resources
 * (spec 2026-06-03-unified-shareable-resource-rbac, User Story 1, contract R2).
 *
 * Generalizes the create/update flow that the dynamic-agents route performs by
 * hand: resolve the creator (set-once), validate the caller may use the owner
 * team, reject owner changes outside the transfer path, read the previous
 * owner/shared set from the config (config = source of truth), reconcile the
 * OpenFGA projection, and persist the next state back to the config.
 *
 * Any resource (agent, knowledge_base/data_source, mcp_tool, and future types)
 * composes this so it gets correct group-based access control without
 * re-implementing the dual-write dance. Enforcement at read/use time stays a
 * standard `requireResourcePermission` check at the resource's own routes.
