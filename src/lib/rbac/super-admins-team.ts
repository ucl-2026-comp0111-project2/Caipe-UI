// Idempotently bootstrap the "Super Admins" team that backs the platform
// default-team selector.
//
// On UI startup (after `reconcileBootstrapAdmins` resolves the bootstrap
// admin emails to Keycloak user subjects) we materialise a team called
// "Super Admins" with slug `super-admins` whose membership mirrors
// `RBAC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAILS`/`BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAILS`:
//
//   - First listed email -> Mongo role=owner, OpenFGA `team:super-admins#admin`
//   - All others         -> Mongo role=admin, OpenFGA `team:super-admins#admin`
//
// The model already implies `member` from `admin` (Option C fix), so we
// only need to write the admin tuple.
//
// The team is marked `source: "system"` and `is_system_managed: true` so the
// generic team APIs (PATCH/DELETE) can refuse rename/delete and the UI can
// show a "managed by platform" badge.
