/**
 * Canonical team-membership reader helpers.
 *
 * Single source of truth for "who is in this team and what is their role"
 * is the `team_membership_sources` Mongo collection (see
 * `team-membership-source-store.ts` for writers). This module is the
 * read-side companion that the rest of the codebase consumes — auth gates,
 * API routes, and Admin UI loaders.
 *
 * Why this exists: pre-2026-05-26, three independent membership stores
 * coexisted (`teams.members[]` embedded array, `team_membership_sources`,
 * and OpenFGA tuples). The OIDC reconciler updated only two of the three,
 * leading to a drift bug where auto-provisioned teams showed "0 members"
 * in the Admin UI even though authorization worked. Spec
 * `docs/docs/specs/2026-05-26-canonical-team-membership/` consolidates
 * onto this module + OpenFGA.
 *
 * Identity dedupe rule: a user is identified by
 * `COALESCE(user_subject, user_email)`. Two source rows for the same
 * effective identity (e.g. one from `okta` and one from `manual`) count
 * as one member. Roles are escalated: if any active row has
 * `relationship: "admin"`, the resolved role is `"admin"`.
 *
 * Status filter: by default only `status: "active"` rows are considered.
 * Removed/stale/disabled rows are excluded. The `includeRemoved` opt-in
 * is reserved for audit views.

 * and ordered for stability — the helper returns members sorted by

 *
