/**
 * Shared helpers for keeping Mongo `teams` membership in sync with the
 * OpenFGA `team:<slug>#{member,admin}` tuples and the
 * `team_membership_sources` collection.
 *
 * Both `POST /api/admin/teams` (team creation) and `POST /api/admin/teams/[id]/members`
 * (adding members to an existing team) must do the same three things every time
 * a Mongo membership row is written:
 *
 *   1. Resolve the Keycloak `sub` for the user's email (OpenFGA stores
 *      `user:<sub>`, never `user:<email>`).
 *   2. Write `user:<sub>#<relation> team:<slug>` tuples to OpenFGA so the
 *      computed `team:<slug>#can_use` / `#can_manage` checks succeed.
 *   3. Upsert the matching row(s) into `team_membership_sources` with the
 *      `user_subject` populated, so `reconcileTeamMembershipSources` can do
 *      drift repair later.
 *
 * The historical bug this module fixes: the team-creation route in
 * `ui/src/app/api/admin/teams/route.ts` did steps 1 and 2 zero times. Teams
 * created via the UI had a Mongo doc + Keycloak client scope but no OpenFGA
 * tuples, which made `OWNER_TEAM_FORBIDDEN` fire on every subsequent agent
 * creation — even for the team's creator.
