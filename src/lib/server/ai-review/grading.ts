/**
 * Aggregate per-criterion verdicts into an overall score + letter grade.
 *
 * Score = sum(weight * pass) / sum(weight). When all weights are zero,
 * score is treated as 1 (no division by zero, no signal of failure).
 *
 * A criterion with `error !== null` is counted as `pass=false` for both
 * numerator (zero weight contribution) and denominator (full weight) —
 * an LLM glitch lowers the score the same way a real fail would. The
 * route layer is responsible for surfacing the `error` field so the user
 * can re-run; the grader stays simple and deterministic.
 *
 * Grades bucket the score by `thresholds`: score ≥ A → A, ≥ B → B, etc.
 * Anything below D is F. Thresholds must be in [0, 1] and ordered
 * A ≥ B ≥ C ≥ D — admin UI enforces ordering; this helper does not.
