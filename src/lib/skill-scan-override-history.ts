/**
 * Skill scan-override history — append-only audit log for admin
 * overrides of skill-scanner verdicts.
 *
 * Persists into Mongo collection `skill_scan_override_history`. One
 * row per `set` and per `clear` action; designed to never block the
 * mutating action (write failures are logged and swallowed). Lives
 * separately from `skill_scan_history` so the rare/sensitive admin
 * action audit trail isn't co-mingled with the high-volume scan-event
 * stream — different retention, different access controls, different
 * compliance reviews.
 *
 * Schema parity with `skill-scan-history.ts`: same `id` convention,
 * same `ts` Date column, same source-kind union, same swallow-on-
 * failure pattern. Future work: an admin UI page that joins this
 * collection with `agent_skills` to render "what's currently
 * overridden, by whom, and why".
