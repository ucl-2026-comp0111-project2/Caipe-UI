/**
 * Shared error type for stream adapters (custom + agui).
 *
 * Both adapters call POST /api/v1/chat/stream/start, which is gated by the
 * Web UI backend's structured auth-error contract (see ui/src/lib/auth-error.ts and
 * ui/src/lib/api-middleware.ts). When the Web UI backend rejects the stream with 401
 * or 403, we want the chat panel to know it was an auth failure (so it can
 * show a toast with a "Sign in" / "Contact admin" affordance) instead of
 * inlining `**Error:** HTTP error: 401 ...` into the assistant turn.
 *
 * The throw-site lives in each adapter's `_stream` method. The catch-site
 * lives in `DynamicAgentChatPanel.submitMessage`.
