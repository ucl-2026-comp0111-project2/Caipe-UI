/**
 * Global crawl-console store. Holds every in-flight + recent
 * crawl run for the admin "Live crawl" dialog.
 *
 * # Why global (not per-row)
 *
 * Two reasons:
 *
 *   1. Concurrency. An admin can kick off a Preview crawl on one
 *      hub, click Refresh on a different hub, and have both
 *      streams running simultaneously. A per-row dialog can only
 *      show one stream at a time and would confuse "I clicked
 *      something three minutes ago, where's the result?". The
 *      global modal has a left-rail run list so all in-flight
 *      runs are visible at once.
 *
 *   2. Survival across navigation. The admin may switch tabs
 *      (Hubs -> Skills -> Audit) while a refresh is running. A
 *      modal anchored to the SkillHubsSection unmounts on tab
 *      switch and the stream gets aborted. The global store
 *      lives at the app shell level, so the stream keeps
 *      running and the dialog can be re-opened from any tab.
 *
 * # Why zustand
 *
 * Aligns with existing project convention for small UI state stores.
 * No context wiring; selectors are cheap; no React-tree
 * dependency for the AbortController plumbing the
 * crawl-stream-client owns.
 *
 * # Persistence
 *
 * Deliberately NONE. The dialog is a live observability tool;
 * persisting in-flight state across page reloads would be
 * misleading (the underlying stream is already gone). Refreshes
 * separately persist the encoded log on the hub doc -- that's
 * the "ask Mongo for the last run" path, distinct from this
 * store.
